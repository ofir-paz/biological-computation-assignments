    "In this question, we will solve the 3-coloring problem using melcular computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, the 3-coloring problem is to assign one of the three colors to each vertex in $V$ such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define a graph $G'$ as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t_1 \\rightarrow (t_{1_A}, t_{1_B}, t_{1_C}) \\rightarrow t_2 \\rightarrow ... \\rightarrow (t_{|V|_A}, t_{|V|_B}, t_{|V|_C}) \\rightarrow z\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t_i$ is the $i$-th vertex in $V$, $t_{i_A}$, $t_{i_B}$, and $t_{i_C}$ are the colors of the $i$-th vertex, and $z$ is just and end point. Each path from $t_1$ to $z$ in the graph where for each $i$, only one of the edges $(t_i, t_{i_A})$, $(t_i, t_{i_B})$, and $(t_i, t_{i_C})$ is selected is a 3-coloring of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The path represents a **valid** 3-coloring iff for all adjacent vertices $t_i, t_j$ in $V$, there is no edge $(t_i, t_{i_X})$ and $(t_j, t_{j_X})$ selected for the same color $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build all DNA strands that represent a path in $G'$ and then filter out the invalid paths. If we have any remaining paths, then the graph $G$ is 3-colorable.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each vertice $t$, in $G'$, we will build a unique sequence composing of 20 bases (or more if $G'$ is too big), and build a sequence for the edges in $G'$ like Adleman did in his paper which was taught in the lecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Amplify the DNA strands that represent a path from $t_1$ to $z$ in $G'$ with PCR using the primers for $t_1$ and $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run the DNA strands through a gel electrophoresis to separate the strands by length, and keep only those strands that we amplified in step 2, with length $(2 \\cdot |V| + 1) \\cdot 20$, leaving us with only the paths from $t_1$ to $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Filter out the invalid paths by checking if there are any adjacent vertices $t_i, t_j$ in $V$ such that there is an edge $(t_i, t_{i_X})$ and $(t_j, t_{j_X})$ selected for the same color $X$. We will do this using an iterative process for all edges $(t_i, t_j)$ in $E$ and all colors $X$:\n",
    "    - We will take all the DNA strands with the subsequence represented by $(t_i, t_{i_X})$ to another tube - $T_1$ using magnetic beads.\n",
    "    - From $T_1$, we will take all the DNA strands with the subsequence represented by $(t_j, t_{j_X})$ to another tube - $T_2$ using magnetic beads.\n",
    "    - We drop the contents of $T_2$, and keep the contents of $T_1$ in the original tube.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. If there are any DNA strands left in the tube, then the graph $G$ is 3-colorable."
