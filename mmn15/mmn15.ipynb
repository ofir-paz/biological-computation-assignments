    "***question:*** Note the main advantages and disadvantages of storing information in DNA compared to traditional digital storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "***answer:*** \n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. High density: DNA can store a large amount of information in a small volume. Example shown in class - 1 Gram of DNA is roughly equivalent to 215 Petabytes of data.\n",
    "2. Longevity: DNA can last for thousands of years if stored properly.\n",
    "3. Low maintenance: DNA does not require power to maintain the information stored.\n",
    "4. Security: DNA is not susceptible to hacking or cyber attacks, as it is not digital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "1. High cost: DNA storage is currently expensive compared to traditional digital storage.\n",
    "2. Slow read/write speeds: Reading and writing data to DNA is slow, the PCR process takes a lot of real-time and needs many iterations.\n",
    "3. Error rate: DNA storage has a higher error rate compared to traditional digital storage, because it is a biological\\chemical process.\n",
    "4. Complexity: DNA storage requires specialized equipment and expertise to read and write data.\n",
    "5. Problems with current infrastructure: Current infrastructure is not designed to handle DNA storage, so it would require significant investment to implement."
